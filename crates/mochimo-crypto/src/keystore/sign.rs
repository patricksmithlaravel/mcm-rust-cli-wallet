//! The signing path: [`Keystore::sign_spend`], the public route to a fresh
//! WOTS+ signature, behind the receipt the keystore mints (I1); its sibling
//! [`Keystore::resign_reserved`] reproduces the one already released.
//!
//! # The shape, and what each choice makes impossible
//!
//! * **The receipt is the only designator.** `sign_spend` takes no tag; the
//!   account is `receipt.tag()`, so "a receipt for A used to sign for B" is
//!   unrepresentable rather than checked. The receipt is consumed by value
//!   and has no `Clone`, so one receipt is at most one call, and it is minted
//!   only after the keystore's four durable steps (I2), so a signature is
//!   released only after its index is on disk.
//! * **The live state is re-checked.** A receipt witnesses the state it was
//!   minted for; `sign_spend` requires the store to still be in that state --
//!   index equal, a reservation present, its digest the one supplied -- so a
//!   hoarded receipt, a reconciliation receipt (`persist_advance_to` sets no
//!   reservation) and a settled one are refused, each by name.
//! * **The key is derived, never stored.** A derived account signs from the
//!   master seed the caller holds ([`KeyAccess::Master`]), borrowed for the
//!   call; the account's tag is recomputed from it and must match, so a
//!   wrong seed, a wrong position or a wrong tag is refused before anything
//!   signs. An imported account signs from its stored root
//!   ([`KeyAccess::StoredRoot`]); nothing is supplied and nothing can be
//!   supplied wrongly. The shapes are an enum so the caller must say which,
//!   and the wrong one is refused in both directions.
//! * **One key stream, one account.** A rotation key is a function of the
//!   32-byte seed alone, so a derived seed also stored as an imported root
//!   would be two indices over one stream; the derived path refuses it, and
//!   since format v2 `Keystore::add` refuses a duplicate stream identity
//!   across kinds, which is the half a drop-and-reopen used to defeat.
//!   This path also re-derives the record's identity from the
//!   master and refuses a disagreement -- the only place a *derived*
//!   record's identity can be checked, since checking it needs the master.
//! * **Nothing is persisted here.** The advance was persisted by
//!   `persist_advance`; a signature adds nothing the store must remember, so
//!   "reserved" and "signed, possibly broadcast" are one on-disk state by
//!   design. What settles it is the chain (I4's reconciliation, not this
//!   module); until then the account cannot spend again, which is the
//!   fail-closed direction.
//! * **A refusal has no side effect** -- no medium call, no memory change --
//!   but **an `Err` from `sign_spend` still consumes the receipt**, so the
//!   reserved key is skipped, not reused. [`Keystore::check_spend`] runs the
//!   same checks on a borrowed receipt so a wrong passphrase costs nothing.
//!
//! # Where the master seed lives
//!
//! With the caller, as a [`Secret`], zeroized on drop; borrowed for one call.
//! The crate retains nothing between calls: every derived intermediate
//! (`DerivedAccount`, `WotsKey`) holds a `Secret` and is dropped before this
//! module returns. `KeyAccess::StoredRoot` means possession of the keystore
//! directory *plus the password* is signing power for imported accounts.
//! **The "plus the password" came with encryption at rest** and this
//! sentence said the opposite for a session after it: under format v3 the record body is sealed under an
//! Argon2id key,
//! so a stolen directory alone yields nothing and
//! `imported_roots_and_the_master_seed_are_encrypted_at_rest` is green. It
//! named the pre-v3 marker `imported_root_is_encrypted_before_it_reaches_the_snapshot`
//! as "still-red" -- a threat model the change had already inverted, left
//! behind by a rename.
//!
//! # The imported first key
//!
//! Position 0 of an imported account signs from the **stored** public seed and
//! hash address, which is the only thing it could ever have done: those
//! components came from the master seed's generator and are not derivable
//! from the root -- three readings of the shipped code agree. Until format
//! v2 they were not in
//! the record, so this arm returned `FirstKeyUnavailable` rather than
//! approximating them, because a plausible substitute produces a valid
//! signature under an address nobody funded -- and the funds an imported
//! account was imported holding sit at exactly that address. The record
//! carries them since format v2 and `Account::import` refuses a pair the root does
//! not reproduce, so the arm derives rather than refuses.
