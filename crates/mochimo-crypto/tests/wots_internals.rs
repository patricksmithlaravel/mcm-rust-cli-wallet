#![cfg(all(feature = "native", not(miri)))]
//! Four shapes of the native WOTS+ internals, pinned with no oracle behind
//! them (AGENT.md, Known-open 22, closed at S8).
//!
//! The corpus pins the VALUES these functions produce on every recorded
//! input -- groups A, AK, B and BK replay key generation, signing and
//! recovery through `backend::native` -- and none of the four shapes below,
//! because each shape is a relation between two functions or a property
//! over inputs no fixture carries:
//!
//! 1. `gen_chain_counted` is a second copy of `gen_chain`'s loop, kept
//!    separate so that its count is independent evidence; nothing but a
//!    test holds the two copies to each other.
//! 2. `wots_checksum` is `pub` over any `[i32; 64]`, its arithmetic wraps
//!    on purpose, and the corpus only ever hands it digits in `0..=15`.
//! 3. `wots_sign_counted` returns the 67 per-chain step counts, and the
//!    corpus records signatures, from which a count is not recoverable.
//! 4. `chain_lengths` confines every digit to `0..=15` through the mask in
//!    `base_w`, and nothing else checks the mask.
//!
//! The differential suite that held these against the linked C left with
//! the C. What stands here is oracle-free: inputs drawn from a small
//! deterministic generator under a constant seed, so every run tries the
//! same inputs and a red names one that can be reproduced; the quantity
//! each test computes on the other side is stated in the test, from the
//! definition, never through the function under test. Every evidence line
//! prints how many inputs were tried, and every test floors that count, so
//! a loop over nothing is red rather than vacuously green.
//!
//! Its own target because its subject is the primitive layer alone:
//! `tests/signing.rs` is the keystore's receipt gate over TypeScript-pinned
//! values and `tests/kat.rs` is the corpus replay, and neither is the place
//! for a property with no recorded value behind it. Gated on `not(miri)`
//! for interpreter time alone, the way `tests/signing.rs` is: the tests
//! here walk tens of thousands of chain steps, and `tests/miri.rs` already
//! walks each of the five functions once under Miri.
